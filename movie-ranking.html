<p>A movie that really made me think about mental health as a kid, </br>
     this movie made me more empathetic towards people and treating everyone kindly, </br>
     we don't know what everyone is going through, everyone is fighting their own battle that none else knows about. </br>
     Everything detail of this movie is perfect and the anmation by kyoto animation is cherry on top. </p>
<li> <h3>The Perks Of Being  A Wallflower</h3></li>
